# Introduction

Brazilian Zouk evolved in the early 1990s in Rio de Janeiro when Lambada dancers
began using the slower, heartbeat‑like rhythms of French‑Caribbean **Zouk** music.

| Trait | Note |
|-------|------|
| Elastic upper‑body flow | Contrasts the hip‑lead power of Lambada |
| Off‑axis / tilted figures | Hallmark “head‑movement” technique |
| Framework for fusion | Works with pop, R&B, lo‑fi, orchestral |
